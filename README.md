# Explanatory Data Analysis

## Stack OverFlow Answers Data

Dataset of answers posted between **February 18 2009 to Jun 7 2009**. Although this dataset does not actually infer the links/patterns because of short time-period, it does provide some insights.

This dataset has been compiled by Chris DuBois from the original [Stack OverFlow data dump](https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/06/04/stack-overflow-creative-commons-data-dump/) by the owners.

By doing EDA, I tried to answer the following Questions:
 - What are the most commonly used tags and what is trend in Data Science related Tags?
 - How many questions are asked w.r.t number of Tags?
 - What is the average time taken to answer a question?
 - How are number of views related to number of Answers?
 - What tags get highest/lowest rating in Questions?
 - What tags get highest/lowest rating in Answers?
 - Which community is the most Active/Inactive in answering the questions?
 - Finding Similar Tags using Word Embeddings (Word2Vec Skiprgam).
 - Finding the topic spread of a user's question.
 - Finding the knowledge/expertise spread of a user.
 - Which tags attract the highest/lowest views?
